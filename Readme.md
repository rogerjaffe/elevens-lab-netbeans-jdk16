`https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I6q4lUPodH22QE0dDdXSCwXSLN6NHZ04K8NEmNKmulo/edit`

Each activity is a separate Netbeans project.

Activities 01, 02, 03, 04, 07, 08, 09, 10, 12, and 14 also have a Tester class to test the code you'll be writing for the activity.
Right-click on the Tester class in the Netbeans project window then click on Run file to run the tester.  The test file will test several aspects of your code and will
report which tests succeed and which tests fail.
